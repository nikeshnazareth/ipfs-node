# Seed Project

## Overview

Initialising a new project often has a number of standard steps.

However, in my experience, the initialisation is always slightly different depending on the 
particular technology or framework. Moreover, integrating the different technologies requires some
configuration.

This project creates a seed project for every combination of technologies (that I use, obviously),
and explicitly lists the steps required.

## Structure

Each git branch corresponds to a different technology (frontend, backend, testing, database, authentication, etc)
or a combination of technologies.

The README in each branch lists the exact steps taken to produce the code on that branch, and how to use the commands.
